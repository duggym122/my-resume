  summary: This is my first original charcuterie recipe - though I really let the Thai culture do all the work. I used my favorite curry paste (Mae Ploy red curry) and simply thinned it out with a bit of hoisin sauce. I put that all over my cured pork tenderloins, and let them dry to a 50% weight loss.
